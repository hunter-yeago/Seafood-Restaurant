## About this Project

I have a passion for learning languages, especially French. In the future, I'd like to build a full-fledged language-learning app, and I've taken this opportunity during my front-end development journey to build a web-app to both showcase my skills, as well as practice building functionality that I'll use in my future projects.

**Creation of a Deck, Studying it, and Resetting user data:**

## Built With:

**Tech:** HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, Webpack
<br>
**Design:** MVC, Observer, Single Page Application

**HTML:**

HTML is dynamically rendered with Javascript and focuses on using semantic elements to comply with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

**SCSS:** 

Responsive design without media queries. Mixins and modules were used to follow the DRY principle and reduce file sizes. I used Andy Bell's CSS [Reset](https://andy-bell.co.uk/a-modern-css-reset/) to reduce browser inconsistencies.

**Javascript:** 

I used the WebStorage API to store user decks locally on their device. For form validation I  implemented the Constraint Validation API to display custom error messages for each form input. Upon successful submission of the form, I convert the input values into a data object using the FormData API and send it to the model to create a Deck object. Additionally, I used a function from the date-fns library to ensure that the chosen due-date for the deck is in the future.

**Resetting user data in local storage:**

**Webpack**

I utilized the Webpack Dev Server for better efficiency when building my project. I also configured the loaders to be able to bundle all assets into a single .js file.

**Design Pattern**

In this Single Page Application, I used the Model-View-Controller design pattern as the foundation for the project, and implemented the Observer pattern to update other parts of the page when there is new data to display.

**The View updating the screen via the Observer:**

## Optimizations

### Responsiveness

This site uses **zero** media queries. Instead, I used other SCSS techniques such as rem units and functions like clamp() and min() to give the site natural responsiveness.

## Lessons Learned:

This project I implemented techniques to write cleaner code I learned from "Clean Code" by Robert Martin. I also implemented the Observer Pattern for the first time within a Model-View-Controller framework. Finally, I utilized WebStorage, Constraint Validation, and Form Data APIs in addition to the data-fns external library to add more complexity to the application.
